Data and code for manuscript "Evidence of extensive extinction debt on dung beetles in grazed grasslands". 

Abstract: Over the past century, intensified land use has caused habitat destruction and species extinctions throughout Europe. However, these extinctions can be delayed by time lag effects, typically measured with species richness. Here, we modelled the impact of land use change and livestock farming practices on both dung beetle species richness and individual abundance in Austria and the Czech Republic. Historic land cover data from the 19th century best explained current species richness and had an even stronger effect on individual abundance. This trend was especially noticeable in species associated with open landscapes, the most heavily modified and declining habitat type in the study area. Our results suggest that population declines may precede species extinctions, potentially masking the true extent of biodiversity loss in short-term studies. The strong time lag in individual abundance highlights that current biodiversity assessments using only species richness may underestimate ongoing species losses, as they donâ€™t account for temporal trends in population size. Additionally, we found that the widespread use of veterinary anthelmintics significantly reduces dung beetle species richness, which calls for reconsideration of veterinary practices to mitigate their unintended consequences on biodiversity.
